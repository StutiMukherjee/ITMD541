            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Stuti, a professional with a passion for harnessing the power of data and unleashing creativity through web technologies. With three years of valuable industry experience under my belt, including a year as a dedicated web production specialist at Dell Technologies, I've gained substantial insights into the dynamic world of technology. Now, I'm on a journey to transition my career into the field of data analysis, leveraging both my professional background and enthusiasm for web technologies. My belief is that the amalgamation of these two domains not only amplifies my analytical capabilities but also allows my creativity to flourish, enabling me to craft data-driven narratives and insights that resonate with audiences.

            <p>        
                With a love for vibrant colors and beautiful designs, I enjoy crafting visually appealing websites and user interfaces that engage and inspire. My skills include HTML, CSS, and other  web development frameworks.
